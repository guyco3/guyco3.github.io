I've deployed my most recent project with the goal of making the process of learning neural networks and PyTorch simpler. The site currently features 15 LeetCode-style problems, covering various topics such as loss functions, activation functions, attention layers, and recurrent layers. Solutions are also included with each problem in case you get stuck.

All the tests and setup work are already built-in, so you just need to implement the equation for the layer in the forward method to complete a problem. See if you can finish all 15 problems (:
