I'm thrilled to announce the launch of TorchCode, a Leetcode-style website for practicing the implementation of neural network layers using PyTorch.

TorchCode is built with a modern tech stack including:
- Typescript
- Python
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend
- React.js and Tailwind for the frontend
- MongoDB for data storage
- Firebase for authentication

The platform allows users to tackle challenges related to implementing various neural network components, helping them deepen their understanding of deep learning architectures and PyTorch.

One of the most exciting aspects of this project was integrating Firebase authentication and utilizing MongoDB to track user progress. This allows users to have a personalized experience and track their learning journey over time.

I'm proud to share that within the first month of deployment, TorchCode gained 20 new user accounts. This early traction is encouraging and suggests that there's a real need for this kind of practical, hands-on learning platform in the deep learning community.

If you're interested in sharpening your PyTorch skills or diving deeper into neural network implementations, give TorchCode a try!
