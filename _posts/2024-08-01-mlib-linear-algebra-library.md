I'm excited to share my latest project: Mlib, a C-based linear algebra library with a Python wrapper. This library is designed to efficiently create and manipulate m-dimensional arrays, complete with built-in auto differentiation.

Key features of Mlib include:
- Implementation of basic operations
- Matrix multiplication
- Matrix inverse calculation
- Reshaping and indexing functionalities

The most exciting outcome of this project is the significant performance boost we achieved. Mlib demonstrates a 24x speed increase for basic matrix operations compared to vanilla Python implementations.

This project was an excellent opportunity to dive deep into the intricacies of linear algebra and optimize for performance. It's been a rewarding experience to see the dramatic speed improvements and to create a tool that can be useful for various computational tasks.

Stay tuned for more updates on Mlib and how you can use it in your own projects!
